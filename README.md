## Introduction

### Introducing Pytest

Pytest is a popular Python testing framework for writing, organizing, and running various types of automated tests. It provides a rich set of features that make it easy to write and manage test cases, as well as generate detailed test reports. Here are some of the key features and benefits of Pytest:

1. **Simple and easy to use**: Pytest is designed to make writing test cases simple and easy to understand. You can write test assertions using Python's standard `assert` statement without having to learn a new assertion syntax.

2. **Automatic Discovery of Test Cases**: Pytest can automatically discover and run test cases in your project without explicitly configuring the test suite. Test case files can be named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`, or use a specific test function naming convention.

3. **Rich plugin ecosystem**: Pytest can be extended with plugins. There are many third-party plug-ins available to meet different testing needs, such as Allure reporting, parameterization, coverage analysis, and so on.

4. **Parameterized Testing**: Pytest supports parameterized testing, which allows you to run the same test case multiple times, but with different parameters. This reduces code duplication and improves test coverage.

5. **Exception and fault localization**: Pytest provides detailed error and exception information that helps you locate and resolve problems more easily. It also provides detailed traceback information.

6. **Parallel Test Execution**: Pytest supports parallel execution of test cases, which increases the speed of test execution, especially in large projects.

7. **Multiple Report Formats**: Pytest supports multiple test report formats, including terminal output, JUnit XML, HTML reports and Allure reports. These reports can help you visualize test results.

8. **Command Line Options**: Pytest provides a rich set of command line options to customize the behavior of test runs, including filtering, retrying, coverage analysis, and more.

9. **Integration**: Pytest can be easily integrated with other testing frameworks and tools (e.g. Selenium, Django, Flask, etc.) as well as continuous integration systems (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI, etc.).

10. **Active Community**: Pytest has an active community with extensive documentation and tutorials for learning and reference. You can also get support and solve problems in the community.

In short, Pytest is a powerful and flexible testing framework for projects of all sizes and types. Its ease of use, automation capabilities, and rich set of plugins make it one of the go-to tools in Python testing.

### Introduction to python virtual environments

A Python virtual environment is a mechanism for creating and managing multiple isolated development environments within a single Python installation. Virtual environments help resolve dependency conflicts between different projects by ensuring that each project can use its own independent Python packages and libraries without interfering with each other. Here are the steps on how to create and use a Python virtual environment:

1. **Install the Virtual Environment Tool**.
   Before you begin, make sure you have installed Python's virtual environment tools. In Python 3.3 and later, the `venv` module is built-in and can be used to create virtual environments. If you're using an older version of Python, you can install the `virtualenv` tool.

   For Python 3.3+, the `venv` tool is built-in and does not require additional installation.

   For Python 2.x, you can install the `virtualenv` tool with the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. **Creating a virtual environment**.
   Open a terminal, move to the directory where you wish to create the virtual environment, and run the following command to create the virtual environment:

   Use `venv` (for Python 3.3+):

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

   Use `virtualenv` (for Python 2.x):

   ```bash
   virtualenv myenv
   ```

   In the above command, `myenv` is the name of the virtual environment and you can customize the name.

3. **Activate virtual environment**.
   To start using the virtual environment, you need to activate it. The activation command is slightly different for different operating systems:

   - on macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

   - On Windows (using Command Prompt):

    ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

   - On Windows (using PowerShell):

    ```bash
     .\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

   Once the virtual environment is activated, you will see the name of the virtual environment in front of the terminal prompt, indicating that you are in the virtual environment.

4. **Installing dependencies in a virtual environment**.
   In a virtual environment, you can use `pip` to install any Python packages and libraries required by your project, and these dependencies will be associated with that virtual environment. Example:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

5. **Using a virtual environment**.
   When working in a virtual environment, you can run Python scripts and use packages installed in the virtual environment. This ensures that your project runs in a separate environment and does not conflict with the global Python installation.

6. **Exiting the virtual environment**.
   To exit the virtual environment, simply run the following command in a terminal:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

   This returns you to the global Python environment.

By using a virtual environment, you can maintain clean dependencies between projects and ensure project stability and isolation. This is a good practice in Python development.

## Project dependencies

> The following environments need to be installed in advance

- [x] python, demo ç‰ˆæœ¬ä¸º v3.11.6

> Just install python 3.x or higher.

## Project directory structure

The following is an example of the directory structure of a Pytest interface automation test project:

> Subsequent demo projects will introduce allure reports, so there will be an additional allure-report directory.

```text
Pytest-allure-demo/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                  # test case files
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_login.py       # Example test case file

### Common Assertions

Using Pytest During the writing of interface automation test cases, we need to use various assertions to verify the expected results of the tests.

Pytest provides more assertions and a flexible library of assertions to fulfill various testing needs.

The following are some of the commonly used Pytest interface automation test assertions:

- **Equality assertion**: checks whether two values are equal.

   ```python
   assert actual_value == expected_value
   ```

- **Unequality Assertion**: checks if two values are not equal.

   ```python
   assert actual_value != expected_value
   ```

- **Containment assertion**: checks whether a value is contained in another value, usually used to check whether a string contains a substring.

   ```python
   assert substring in full_string
   ```

- **Membership Assertion**: checks whether a value is in a collection, list, or other iterable object.

   ```python
   assert item in iterable
   ```

- **Truth Assertion**: checks whether an expression or variable is true.

   ```python
   assert expression
   ```

   OR

   ```python
   assert variable
   ```

- **False Value Assertion**: checks whether an expression or variable is false.

   ```python
   assert not expression
   ```

   OR

   ```python
   assert not variable
   ```

- **Greater Than, Less Than, Greater Than Equal To, Less Than Equal To Assertion**: checks whether a value is greater than, less than, greater than equal to, or less than equal to another value.

   ```python
   assert value > other_value
   assert value < other_value
   assert value >= other_value
   assert value <= other_value
   ```

- **Type Assertion**: checks that the type of a value is as expected.

   ```python
   assert isinstance(value, expected_type)
   ```

   For example, to check if a value is a string:

   ```python
   assert isinstance(my_string, str)
   ```

- **Exception Assertion**: checks to see if a specific type of exception has been raised in a block of code.

   ```python
   with pytest.raises(ExpectedException):
       # Block of code that is expected to raise an ExpectedException.
   ```

- **Approximate Equality Assertion**: checks whether two floating-point numbers are equal within some margin of error.

   ```python
   assert math.isclose(actual_value, expected_value, rel_tol=1e-9)
   ```

- **List Equality Assertion**: checks if two lists are equal.

   ```python
   assert actual_list == expected_list
   ```

- **Dictionary Equality Assertion**: checks if two dictionaries are equal.

   ```python
   assert actual_dict == expected_dict
   ```

- **Regular Expression Match Assertion**: checks if a string matches the given regular expression.

   ```python
   import re

   assert re.match(pattern, string)
   ```

- **Null Assertion**: checks whether a value is `None`ã€‚

   ```python
   assert value is None
   ```

- **Non-null value assertion**: checks if a value is not `None`ã€‚

   ```python
   assert value is not None
   ```

- **Boolean Assertion**: checks whether a value of `True` or `False`ã€‚

   ```python
   assert boolean_expression
   ```

- **Empty Container Assertion**: checks if a list, collection or dictionary is empty.

   ```python
   assert not container  # Check if the container is empty
   ```

- **Contains Subset Assertion**: checks whether a set contains another set as a subset.

   ```python
   assert subset <= full_set
   ```

- **String Beginning or End Assertion**: checks whether a string begins or ends with the specified prefix or suffix.

    ```python
    assert string.startswith(prefix)
    assert string.endswith(suffix)
    ```

- **Quantity Assertion**: checks the number of elements in a list, collection, or other iterable object.

    ```python
    assert len(iterable) == expected_length
    ```

- **Range Assertion**: checks if a value is within the specified range.

    ```python
    assert lower_bound <= value <= upper_bound
    ```

- **Document Existence Assertion**: checking whether a document exists or notã€‚

    ```python
    import os

    assert os.path.exists(file_path)
    ```

These are some common Pytest assertions, but depending on your specific testing needs, you may want to use other assertions or combine multiple assertions to more fully validate your test results.
Detailed documentation on assertions can be found on the official Pytest website at:[Pytest - Built-in fixtures, marks, and nodes](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#pytest)

### Data-driven

In the process of API automation testing. The use of data-driven is a regular testing methodology where the input data and expected output data of the test cases are stored in data files, and the testing framework executes multiple tests based on these data files to validate various aspects of the API.

The test data can be easily modified without modifying the test case code.

Data-driven testing helps you cover multiple scenarios efficiently and ensures that the API works properly with a variety of input data.

Refer to the demo:<https://github.com/Automation-Test-Starter/Pytest-API-Test-Demo>

#### Create the test configuration file

> Configuration file will be stored in json format for example, other formats such as YAML, CSV, etc. are similar, can be referred to.

```bash
// create a new config folder
mkdir config
// enter the config folder
cd config
// create a new configuration file
touch config.json
```

#### Writing Test Configuration Files

The configuration file stores the configuration information of the test environment, such as the URL of the test environment, database connection information, and so on.

The contents of the test configuration file in the demo are as follows:

- Configure host information
- Configure the getAPI interface information.
- Configure the postAPI interface information.

```json
{
  "host": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
  "getAPI": "/posts/1",
  "postAPI":"/posts"
}
```

#### Create the test data file

The request data file and the response data file store the request data and the expected response data of the test case, respectively.

```bash
// create a new data folder
mkdir data
// enter the data folder
cd data
// create a new request data file
touch request_data.json
// create a new response data file
touch response_data.json
```

#### Writing test data files

- Writing the request data file

> The request data file is configured with the request data for the getAPI API and the request data for the postAPI API.

```json
{
  "getAPI": "",
  "postAPI":{
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1
  }
}
```

- Writing the response data file

> The request data file is configured with the response data for the getAPI API and the response data for the postAPI API.

```json
{
    "getAPI": {
      "userId": 1,
      "id": 1,
      "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
      "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
    },
    "postAPI":{
      "title": "foo",
      "body": "bar",
      "userId": 1,
      "id": 101
    }
}
```

#### Updating test cases to support data driving

> To differentiate, here is a new test case file named test_demo_data_driving.py

```python
import requests
import json

# get the test configuration information from the configuration file
with open("config/config.json", "r") as json_file:
    config = json.load(json_file)

# get the request data from the test data file
with open('data/request_data.json', 'r') as json_file:
    request_data = json.load(json_file)

# get the response data from the test data file
with open('data/response_data.json', 'r') as json_file:
    response_data = json.load(json_file)


class TestPytestDemo:

    def test_get_demo(self):
        host = config.get("host")
        get_api = config.get("getAPI")
        get_api_response_data = response_data.get("getAPI")
        # send request
        response = requests.get(host+get_api)
        # assert
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == get_api_response_data

    def test_post_demo(self):
        host = config.get("host")
        post_api = config.get("postAPI")
        post_api_request_data = request_data.get("postAPI")
        post_api_response_data = response_data.get("postAPI")
        # send request
        response = requests.post(host + post_api, post_api_request_data)
        # assert
        assert response.status_code == 201
        assert response.json() == post_api_response_data
```

#### Run the test case to confirm the data driver is working

> If you run the data driver support test case with demo project: test_demo_data_driving.py, it is recommended to block other test cases first, otherwise it may report errors.
  
```shell
  pytest tests/test_demo_data_driving.py
```

### Multi-environment support

In the actual API automation testing process, we need to run test cases in different environments to ensure that the API works properly in each environment.

By using Pytest's fixture feature, we can easily support multiple environments.

Refer to the demo:<https://github.com/Automation-Test-Starter/Pytest-API-Test-Demo>

#### New test configuration files for different environments

> Configuration file will be stored in json format for example, other formats such as YAML, CSV, etc. are similar, can refer to the

```bash
// Create a new test configuration folder
mkdir config
// Go to the test configuration folder 
cd config
// Create a new test configuration file for the development environment
touch dev_config.json
// Create a new test configuration file for the production environment
touch prod_config.json
```

#### Writing different environment test profiles

- Writing Development Environment Test Profiles

> Configure the development environment test profiles according to the actual situation.

```json
{
  "host": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
  "getAPI": "/posts/1",
  "postAPI":"/posts"
}
```

- Configuring Production Environment Test Profiles

> Configure production environment test profiles according to the actual situation

```json
{
  "host": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
  "getAPI": "/posts/1",
  "postAPI":"/posts"
}
```

#### New Different Environment Test Data File

> The different environments request data file and the response data file store the different environments request data and the different environments expected response data for the test cases, respectively.

```bash
// Create a new test data folder
mkdir data
// Go to the test data folder
cd data
// Create a new dev request data file
touch dev_request_data.json
// Create a new dev response data file
touch dev_response_data.json 
// Create a new request data file for the production environment
touch prod_request_data.json 
// Create a new production response data file
touch prod_response_data.json 
```

#### Writing test data files for different environments

- Write the dev environment request data file

> The dev environment request data file is configured with the request data for the getAPI API and the request data for the postAPI API.

```json
{
  "getAPI": "",
  "postAPI":{
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1
  }
}
```

- Writing the dev Environment Response Data File

> The dev environment response data file is configured with the response data for the getAPI API and the response data for the postAPI API.

```json
{
    "getAPI": {
      "userId": 1,
      "id": 1,
      "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
      "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
    },
    "postAPI":{
      "title": "foo",
      "body": "bar",
      "userId": 1,
      "id": 101
    }
}
```

- Write the prod environment request data file

> The prod environment request data file is configured with the request data for the getAPI API and the request data for the postAPI API.

```json
{
  "getAPI": "",
  "postAPI":{
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1
  }
}
```

- Writing the prod Environment Response Data File

> The prod environment response data file is configured with the response data for the getAPI API and the response data for the postAPI API.

```json
{
    "getAPI": {
      "userId": 1,
      "id": 1,
      "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
      "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
    },
    "postAPI":{
      "title": "foo",
      "body": "bar",
      "userId": 1,
      "id": 101
    }
}
```

#### Configure fixture to support multiple environments

The > fixture will be stored in the conftest.py file as an example, other formats such as YAML, CSV, etc. are similar.

- Create a new conftest.py file in the project root directory.

```bash
 mkdrir conftest.py
```

- Writing the conftest.py file

```python

import pytest
import json
import json
import os


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def env_config(request):
    # get config file from different env
    env = os.getenv('ENV', 'dev')
    with open(f'config/{env}_config.json', 'r') as config_file:
        config = json.load(config_file)
    return config


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def env_request_data(request):
    # get request data file from different env
    env = os.getenv('ENV', 'dev')
    with open(f'data/{env}_request_data.json', 'r') as request_data_file:
        request_data = json.load(request_data_file)
    return request_data


@pytest.fixture (scope="session")
def env_response_data(request):
    # get response data file from different env
    env = os.getenv('ENV', 'dev')
    with open(f'data/{env}_response_data.json', 'r') as response_data_file:
        response_data = json.load(response_data_file)
    return response_data
```

#### Update test case to support multi environment

> To make a distinction, here is a new test case file named test_demo_multi_environment.py

```python
import requests
import json


class TestPytestMultiEnvDemo:

    def test_get_demo_multi_env(self, env_config, env_request_data, env_response_data):
        host = env_config["host"]
        get_api = env_config["getAPI"]
        get_api_response_data = env_response_data["getAPI"]
        # send request
        response = requests.get(host+get_api)
        # assert
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == get_api_response_data

    def test_post_demo_multi_env(self, env_config, env_request_data, env_response_data):
        host = env_config["host"]
        post_api = env_config["postAPI"]
        post_api_request_data = env_request_data["postAPI"]
        post_api_response_data = env_response_data["postAPI"]
        # send request
        response = requests.post(host + post_api, post_api_request_data)
        # assert
        assert response.status_code == 201
        assert response.json() == post_api_response_data
```

#### Run this test case to confirm that multi-environment support is in effect

- Run the dev environment test case

```shell
ENV=dev pytest test_case/test_demo_multi_environment.py
```
